# AnthropometricsToday

In the 1880s students in Cambridge had their head measured to
test for correlations between head size and degree class
(https://goo.gl/Tbfoww). To celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the Cambridge Philosophical Society, a major public exhibition
will reconstruct this experience. You will use computer vision to
measure visitors' profiles, matching against archive records of
thousands of ex-students to identify a (possibly famous)
historical twin, and then render a simulation of a new
"handwritten" record card that can be accessed online to
compare your future grades to theirs.
