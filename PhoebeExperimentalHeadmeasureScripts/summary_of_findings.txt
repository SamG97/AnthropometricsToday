We can use the python libraries cv2 or face_recognition

Advantages of face_recognition:
    Can get ocular width easily
    Easy to install

Advantages of cv2:
    Seems more powerful
    Has profile detection, although I can't get this to actually work

Disadvantages of cv2:
    Does not give any meaningful measurements

Disadvantages of face_recognition:
    Will not be able to do the profile measurement



My suggestion:
Use face_recognition to get occular width, face width, and face height. Give up
on using a neural net to get the profile measurement, and use thresholding if
this measurement is needed. Perhaps it is not needed.
